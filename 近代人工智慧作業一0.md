UCS is the spacial case of A* since A*'s evalution function is f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
. Take h(n)=0 then f(n)=g(n) is UCS's evalution function. Additionally, BFS is UCS spacial case, since take g(n)=c ,where c in R. It will serch first node in the tree. Which is same as BFS

1-3

Greedy is the spacial case of A* since A*'s evalution function is f(n)=g(n)+h(n)
. Take g(n)=0 then f(n)=h(n) is Greedy's evalution function. DFS is Greedy spacial case,since DFS will serch first node in its child node. However Greedy  desired serch largest value to its child node.
