2.What's the gap in this field?
The other patents use phisic method like inverse kenimatic to calculate the step path. Many quadruped robot use electronic and Hybrid hydraulic to drive it. Few of them use gas robot to transfer heavy item on the road or react to human. Maybe I just didn't find the patent.

3.Your proposed method is novel?
My method is to calculate the step path on the quadruped robot. Many patent is invent lots of methon. So it may hard to propose new method but can applicate the robot on trantport item.
